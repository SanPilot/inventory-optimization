CS4100: Artificial Intelligence
Final Project Brainstorm
28 November 2021
================
Variety Packs with Contraints and Preferences

The Model - as simple as possible
	Handles inventory
	Class represents possible distribution of items between inventory and customer orders
		Possibly using hash-maps keyed on customer ids
	Languages: JS/TS (web-based UI), Python or Java (terminal UI)
	Fitness function to evaluate an assignment - see weighted CSP below

Approaches:
	Weighted CSP to represent the problem
		Either part of the model or a seperate fitness function to evaluate score/fitness of an assignment
		Define unary/binary/k-ary contraints as functions
	Trivial solution: experiment with DFS/BFS/A* search to find a optimal solution, determine if possible
	Local-search:
		Hill-climbing - find the action with the greatest reward
			w/ simulated annealing - add random heat to calculated rewards
		Genetic algorithms - "fitness" of solution determines the probability of being selected for the next generation
	Reinforcement Learning:
		Approximate Q-learning with weighted parameters
			Reward function is the increase in fitness

How to present
	Text/terminal-based UI	- fast to implement, not as visually impressive
	Web UI					- slower to implement, more visual and presentable
								- completely frontend based to reduce complexity and dev time
								- possible add'l interactive feature - students can enter orders during the presention


Pivot ideas
	1. Tracking COVID waves throughout US states using Bayesian HMMs/LSTMs
		Correlate flight/highway travel data with historal COVID cases data
		Generate possible heatmaps/animations of COVID waves
		Predict future COVID hotspots
